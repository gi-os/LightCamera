     * row length, so `rowStride` is routinely larger than `width` and the buffer is bigger than the

     * one above it, which reads as "the scanner just doesn't work at some resolutions". So each row
     * is copied out at its own offset.
     *
     * Rotation is not handled and does not need to be: a QR code is found by its three finder
     * squares, which ZXing locates in two dimensions, so it decodes upside down and sideways alike.
