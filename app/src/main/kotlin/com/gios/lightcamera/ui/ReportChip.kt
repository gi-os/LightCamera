/**
 * A small offer in the corner, rather than a sheet across the screen.
 *
 * This replaced a modal sheet asking "did you mean to send an error report?", which was the wrong
 * shape for the question. The gesture that raises it is one the phone can misread, so the cost of
 * being wrong is paid *every* time it is wrong — and a sheet that covers what you were reading, on
 * a 3.92" screen, to ask about something you did not ask about, is a bad trade against a report
 * that might not exist.
 *
 * So the offer is small, it sits out of the way, and **silence is an answer**: ignore it for four
 * seconds and it fades. Nothing is lost by ignoring it — the same report is always available from
 * the settings screen, and an unsent crash log is offered again on the next launch. Only the tap
 * costs anything, and only the tap opens the sheet.
