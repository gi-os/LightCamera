/**
 * Was that a shake, or was that a pocket?
 *
 * The question is harder than it looks, because the accelerometer cannot tell the two apart by
 * force alone: setting the phone down hard, a step while it is in your hand, and a jolt in a bag
 * all clear any threshold a real shake clears. What only a shake does is *reverse*. So this
 * counts sign changes in the deviation from rest rather than peaks: during a shake the magnitude
 * swings above 1g as the arm drives the phone and below 1g as it lets go at the end of each
 * throw, so a deliberate rattle alternates six times in about a second, and walking — a slow
 * bob well inside the threshold — never alternates at all.
 *
 * Deliberately free of Android imports so the arithmetic can be tested on the JVM; the sensor
 * plumbing lives in `report/ShakeDetector.kt`.
